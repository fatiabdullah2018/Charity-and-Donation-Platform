## Overview

This decentralized charity platform leverages blockchain technology to transform philanthropic giving by creating direct connections between donors and beneficiaries, ensuring complete transparency in fund movement, and providing verifiable impact measurement.

### Mission
To build a global charitable ecosystem that maximizes impact through transparency, efficiency, and direct donor-to-beneficiary connections while eliminating intermediaries and reducing administrative costs.

## Architecture

The platform is built on a robust blockchain foundation with specialized smart contracts, transparent fund tracking, and a user-friendly interface accessible to donors and charitable organizations worldwide.

### Core Components:
1. **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum-based contracts managing all platform operations
2. **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS for storing charity documentation and impact evidence
3. **Web and Mobile Interface**: User-friendly applications for all participants
4. **Verification System**: For charity authentication and project validation
5. **Oracle Integration**: For impact data verification from real-world sources

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Charity Contract
Manages charity profiles, verification, and fundraising campaigns
- **Functions**:
    - `registerCharity(name, mission, documentation)`: Creates a verified charity profile
    - `launchCampaign(title, description, target, deadline)`: Initiates a fundraising campaign
    - `updateProfile(fields, newValues)`: Modifies charity information
    - `getCharityMetrics()`: Returns performance and trust metrics
    - `withdrawFunds(campaignId, amount, purpose)`: Transfers funds with specified purpose

### 2. Donation Contract
Handles donor profiles, contribution management, and fund allocation
- **Functions**:
    - `donate(campaignId, amount, restrictions)`: Processes a donation with optional restrictions
    - `setRecurringDonation(campaignId, amount, frequency)`: Establishes automatic recurring donations
    - `allocateFunds(donationId, projects)`: Distributes donation across multiple initiatives
    - `getDonationHistory(donorAddress)`: Returns complete giving history for a donor
    - `cancelRecurringDonation(donationId)`: Terminates a recurring donation arrangement

### 3. Transparency Contract
Tracks fund movement and ensures compliance with donor stipulations
- **Functions**:
    - `recordExpenditure(campaignId, amount, purpose, evidence)`: Documents how funds are used
    - `generateTransparencyReport(campaignId)`: Creates detailed fund usage reports
    - `verifyCompliance(donationId, expenditureId)`: Confirms alignment with donor restrictions
    - `flagConcern(campaignId, issue)`: Allows stakeholders to raise compliance questions
    - `auditTrail(campaignId)`: Returns complete history of all fund movements

### 4. Impact Measurement Contract
Quantifies, validates, and reports the real-world effects of donations
- **Functions**:
    - `defineMetrics(campaignId, indicators)`: Establishes measurable impact indicators
    - `recordImpact(campaignId, metric, value, evidence)`: Documents achieved results
    - `validateImpact(impactId, validatorAddress)`: Confirms reported impact through third parties
    - `calculateROI(donationId)`: Determines social return on investment
    - `generateImpactReport(donorAddress)`: Creates personalized impact summaries for donors
